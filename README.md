Parallel Computing
=======================
The following code was written by **Shrey Gupta** as part of **Parallel Computing**, a course offered at **Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology**. Parts of the code may have been written by Dr. Shane Torbert and Dr. John Zacharias, the directors of the course.

Note that the following code was written in C and will require C to run. In order to run a program, navigate to the containing folder in Terminal and run the file:

```
$ cd Parallel-Computing
$ gcc file_name.c
$ ./a.out
```

**Major labs/programs**:

1. **Huffman Decoder** (decode.c): decodes a message compressed via the Huffman algorithm.
2. **Huffman Encoder** (encode.c): encodes and compresses a message via the Huffman algorithm.
